# ESP32-BTaudiointernal
Use ESP32 a2dp bluetooth profile to recieve generated audio from a device and stream it to the internal DAC of the esp32.

This library contains basic Digital Sound Processing (DSP) by having the ability to add a low pass filter or a High pass filter.
I am currently having difficulty on getting the DRC to function on the internal DAC on the esp32.
This is very first project on GitHub and will not be perfect. I may update this library later on to introduce new features and to improve stablity. 

# Installation 

Download the code 
extract to your Documents/Arduino/libraries
(C:/Users/(your username)/Documents/Arduino/libraries) - Windows

more will be added later on.
